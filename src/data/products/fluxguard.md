My strange physical modeling real time synth that has been free on android since 2009.

- Uses Java 
- Calls into a c based library for DSP called csound from JNI 
- Has a pretty basic UI right now 
- No native Midi support for the csound 
- Future features - moving to WASM and react/redux with a trusted progressive web app
